# **Financial Sentimental Analysis and Build Financial Sentimental Classifier using BERT and FinBERT by transfer learning and Traditional Alogrithms (TF-IDF, SVM, Logistic Regression )**

ABOUT THE DATASET 
The following data is intended for advancing financial sentiment analysis research. It's two datasets (FiQA, Financial PhraseBank) combined into one easy-to-use CSV file. It provides financial sentences with sentiment labels.

WHAT WE ARE DOING:
1) Preprcoessing the data and Exploratory data Analysis.
2) Building Financial Sentimental classifier using  FinBERT , BERT model by transfer learning the model and using traditional models(TFIDF , SVM, LOGISTIC REGRESSION) for Financial Sentimental classification
NOTE : TRANSFER LEARNING : we are freezing 10 layers and training rest of the layers then evaluating our model performance in terms of F1, recall, accuracy and confusion matrix.
 3) Comparision and conclusion
