## Financial Sentimental Analysis and Build Financial Sentimental Classifier using BERT finetuning , FinBERT finetuning , BERT transfer learning , FinBERT transfer learning and Traditional ALogrithms (TF-IDF, SVM, Logistic Regression ) 
# In this note book you will find EDA of  Financial Sentimental data fro kaggle 

ABOUT THE DATASET 
The following data is intended for advancing financial sentiment analysis research. It's two datasets (FiQA, Financial PhraseBank) combined into one easy-to-use CSV file. It provides financial sentences with sentiment labels.

WHAT WE ARE DOING:
1) Preprcoessing the data and Exploratory data Analysis
2) Building Financial Sentimental classifier using  FINBERT model by finetuning , finetuning BERT model and using traditional models(TFIDF , SVM, LOGISTIC REGRESSION) for Financial Sentimental classification
3) Comparative analysis by transfer learning FINBERT, transfer learning BERT and traditional models(TFIDF , SVM, LOGISTIC REGRESSION) of classification 
NOTE : TRANSFER LEARNING : we are freezing 10 layers and training rest of the layers then evaluating our model performance in terms of F1, recall, accuracy and confusion matrix.
